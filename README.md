## Overview

The XYZ Construction Company in King County would like to invest on the old houses to possibly built a brand new complex living or building to increace more living space for the community as well as expand companies profit value. The key of the project is finding minimum price houses with maximum square feet lot in order to built either complex living or building. I will determine the King County House Sales data to determine minimum price houses (for purchase) in maximum square feet lot (for maximum living space) with Linear Regression models.
